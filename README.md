# Fish-Feeder
  Ever wonder how hard it is to take care of a fish?
  That is why we invented and programed the FishFeeder a product made for those fish owners that sometimes forget feeding them. 
Our product it is an automatic fish feeder that feeds your fish based on the species and quantity, above all you can set the gap 
of time your fish will be fed and if needed stop the process to reprogam, all that easily made by three buttons.

  The heart of the system it is based in an Arduino that can understant user input through buttons, from that controls the servo 
  motor to release the right amount of food, by editing the time we let it open. The current state of the system and user selections
  are displayed on an LCD, making the system user-friendly and highly interactive.

  The code has been carefully structured with modular functions to facilitate future maintenance and updates. Additionally, an efficient use of 
the Arduino's millis() function has been employed for time control, avoiding the use of delays that could make the system unresponsive.

  The external part of the project it is made by ice cream sticks and a paper cup, although they are not watter proof they are very easy to find and fun to recycle. 
 
  By using microcontrollers to automate daily tasks, we can make your life easier.
